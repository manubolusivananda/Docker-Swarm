TITLE = DOCKER SWARM
FIRST OFF ALL WHAT IS DOCKER SWARM ?
--> Tt is an orchestration tool for containers.
--> used to manage multiple containers on multiple servers.
--> here we can create cluster --> what is means it is a group of servers.
--> in that cluster we can create same containe on multiple servers.
--> here we have the manager node and worker node.
--> the purpose of manager node will create and distribute the container to worker nodes.
--> worker node main purpose is to maintain the containers
--> without docker engine we cannot create the cluster
--> port number is 2377
--> it has high avalibility  means more than one server.
--> worker node wii join on manager node by using token then only my worker node communicate.
--> individual containers are not going to replicate to worker nodes
--> if we create a service then only container will be distributed.
WHAT IS SERVICE =its a way of exposing and manage multiple container in docker swarm
in service we can create copy of containers 
that containers copies will be distributed to all the nodes.
PROCESS:
first: create a 3 servers
    1.manager node
    2.worker node-1
    3.worker node-2
second:
    install docker engine three servers yum install docker -y
third:
go to manager node give command 
   docker swarm init it will generate the token
fourth:
copy that token and go and paste worker node-1 and workernode-2 then will be communicate to manager node.
set is complted 

THEN I WANT CREATE CONTAINER
docker run -itd --name cont1 -p 81:80 sivanandkatta/latest(this is my image)
now go and take ip add and paste to newtap it will runing the application.
